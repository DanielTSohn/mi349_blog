                <p>
                    In the magical world of <em>100</em> rated chess the higher level tactics and strategy go out the window. 
                    With blunders left and right and opening theory in the garbage can, it can be easy to lose yourself in this battlefield.
                    While it may seem daunting, it is quite easy to fit in once you know the basic rules 100 rated players stick to.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First off, blunders, while it may seem against all logic to repeatedly blunder pieces, including the queen, to the enemy; 
                    All blunders are secretly engaging in the mental warfare of is it a blunder, or is it a trap? 
                    Eventually the other player might not take the blunder, which then allows you, the player, to make further aggressive plays.
                    Not only that, by being unpredictable, you can confuse the the opponent by playing moves that you don't understand. 
                    After all, if even you don't know what you're doing, how can the opponent?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some other general rules to staying at 100 elo rating are the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Move your Queen early; It's the strongest piece, shouldn't you use as soon as possible?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Move the same piece as much as possible; 
                            It's important to get pieces in just the right position, why not spend some extra time getting there?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use your king to capture when possible; 
                            Your king the the most important piece in the game, why show weakness and hide it away in a corner where it can't be attacked?
                            Move it as close the opponents side as possible to assert your dominance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Blunder a piece and the opponent doesn't take it? Don't move the piece to safety, 
                            that shows you know you made a mistake and are fixing it. 
                            If you don't acknowledge your mistake the opponent can't make fun of you for it.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    To finish everything off, the most important rule of all time at low rated chess;
                    <i><em>En Passant is mandatory</em></i>
                    <figure id = "EnPassant">
                        <img src="En_passant.jpg" alt="Three chess board slices with three columns and eight rows each; 
                        The rows are indicated by numbers 1 to 8 and the columns with letters a to c.
                        Black is on top and white is on bottom, white pawns move upwards. 
                        On the first chess board slice there are two black pawns, one on a5 and the other on b4. 
                        White has two pawns also, one on a2 and the other b2.
                        There is an arrow showing the a2 pawn will move to a4 the next turn. 
                        This is shown by the next slice with the a2 pawn now on a4. 
                        There is now an arrow showing that the black pawn on b4 can move to a3 to capture the a4 pawn. 
                        The final slice shows this with the final state being: Two black pawns, one on a5 and the other on a3; One white pawn on b2. 
                        This showcases how En Passant allows pawns to capture a pawn that use a double move to resolve the fact they would not normally be able to capture that way."><br>

                    It matters not what it costs, be you losing checkmate, or you getting checkmated. 
                    Sometimes, the shock value of doing this move alone is enough to make opponent resign because they think your a hacker.
                    All in all, passing down this fancy move can never happen in a 100 rated game.

                <h3>Game Modes</h3>
                <header class = "postInfo">
                    <address class="author"><a rel = "author" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-sohn-668428234/">Daniel Sohn </a></address>>

                <p>
                    When one has hit rock bottom elo, it would be normal to ask, is there really a difference between game modes when playing at the lowest level?
                    The answer to that, is a resounding yes, but then the question comes up, just what is different?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For one, the average skill is drastically different from each main mode; Those modes being bullet, blitz, rapid, and daily. 
                    For beginners to chess, I recommend playing 1|0 bullet as the first mode to play the worst chess you've ever played. 
                    Bullet means players are prone to more mistakes due to the time pressure, and with only one minute and no time gain, flagging / running out of time is almost guaranteed.
                    Not only will you make mistakes that teach you nothing, you have no time to think about why what you did was wrong! 
                    On top of that, you don't even get to learn from your opponent once you go low enough! 
                    Why play chess when you can do the equivalent of smashing your face on the keyboard to write an essay?
                    <figure id = "chessClock">
                        <img src="Chess_clock.jpg" alt="Image of a chess clock at 2 minutes for each side, 
                        there is a seesaw type button on the top that makes the non depressed side's timer count down.">
                        <figcaption>Example of chess clock <cite><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DGT_2010_digital_chess_clock.ajb.jpg">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DGT_2010_digital_chess_clock.ajb.jpg</a></cite></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>
                    While it may seem challenging to be bad at longer game modes, especially daily, there's actually a secret technique to hinder your performance. 
                    How does one not learn anything while having a day or even a week to examine the next move? 
                    Simple, play every mode like bullet. Have 10 minutes on the clock? Use 4 seconds. 
                    Queen in danger of being trapped and captured? Take 1 second to make the next move. 
                    Not only do you make your play worse, you don't even get to learn from the experience by making an obvious mistake most of the time, amazing deal!
